# TODO(Ryan): If tests pass, put in a database (serial-number, date-passed, firmware-revision, pcba-revision)
# Also include a static analysis and code coverage (for certification) metric in database
# also include performance metrics, e.g. cpu load, ram snapshots, battery life etc.

# Prioritise testing features, and risky code (battery, firmware update, factory reset)
